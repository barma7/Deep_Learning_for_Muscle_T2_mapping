# Deep_Learning_for_Muscle_T2_mapping
The repository provides the source code for "A Deep Learning Approach for Fast Muscle Water T2 Mapping with Subject Specific Fat T2 Calibration from Multi-Spin-Echo Acquisitions"

** Deep Learning Application **
The deep learning application has been developed in TensorFlow.
TensorFlow, Numpy, and Scipy are required to run the deep learning application.

The EPG code for simulating the Multi-Echo-Spin-Echo (MESE) data is provided in Matlab.
The core EPG function is taken from the StimFit toolbox (https://github.com/usc-mrel/StimFit).
